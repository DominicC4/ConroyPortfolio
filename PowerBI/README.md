Overview
This project analyzes over 40 million ad impressions, 83,000 clicks, and $87,000 in ad spend to identify when digital display campaigns perform most efficiently. Using Power Query for data cleaning and Power BI for visualization, the goal was to uncover high-ROI time windows and guide smarter budget allocation decisions.

Objective
Determine which hours and days of the week deliver the best click-to-site efficiency and provide clear recommendations for optimizing ad spend.

Tools Used
Power Query, Power BI, Excel

Process

Cleaned and mapped multiple advertising exports using Power Query joins and merges.

Standardized columns and removed duplicates to ensure consistency.

Calculated Click-to-Site-per-Dollar and total advertiser cost by day and hour.

Built a Power BI dashboard with campaign filters and a color-coded performance heat map.

Key Insights

Monday and Friday evenings (6–10 PM) achieved the highest click-to-site efficiency.

Early morning hours (5–7 AM) showed the lowest performance.

Recommended reallocating ad spend toward high-efficiency time windows (green zones).

Takeaways
This project strengthened my skills in data mapping, cleaning, and visualization, and demonstrated how Power BI can translate marketing data into business recommendations.
